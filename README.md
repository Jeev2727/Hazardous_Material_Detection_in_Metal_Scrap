# Hazardous Material Detection using YOLOv8 and Flask
This project detects hazardous materials (gas cylinders, fire extinguishers, shock absorbers, etc,.) in metal scrap using a YOLOv8 segmentation model and serves it through a web-based Flask application. Users can upload both images and videos, view annotated predictions, and see object counts in a clean, responsive interface.

# Project Overview

- Built a YOLOv8 segmentation model to identify high-risk objects in metal scrap environments.
- Addressed challenges such as class imbalance, limited data, and noisy backgrounds.
- Deployed the model through a modern Flask web app with support for both images and videos.
