# Hazardous_Material_Detection_in_Metal_Scrap
This project detects hazardous materials (gas cylinders, fire extinguishers, shock absorbers, etc,.) in metal scrap using a YOLOv8 segmentation model and serves it through a web-based Flask application. Users can upload both images and videos, view annotated predictions, and see object counts in a clean, responsive interface.
